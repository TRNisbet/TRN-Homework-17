## Other Information:
Locally deployed since I had an issue pushing to heroku.  Video walkthrough is avaiable here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y9Ar8JYjvb6avhakEBbe1x_N6zUfHMty/view  Github is available here: https://github.com/TRNisbet/TRN-Homework-17 --- When refreshing in the video local hosts defaults to a previous assignment.  TI has been doing that since the asignment and I do not know how to solve it but a hard refresh will show the correct output.
